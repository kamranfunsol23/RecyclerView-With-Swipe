# RecyclerView-With-Swipe
Project Title: RecyclerView Swipe Actions (Kotlin)

Description:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a RecyclerView with swipe actions using Kotlin for Android app development. The app showcases two types of swipe interactions:

Reorder Items: Users can swipe items up and down to change their positions in the list. The ItemTouchHelper class is utilized to handle the drag-and-drop functionality.

Delete Items: Swiping items to the left or right triggers their removal from the list. The ItemTouchHelper is also used for this action.

The RecyclerView is populated with sample data and utilizes a custom adapter. The project is a practical example of incorporating swipe gestures to enhance user experience in a list-based UI.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own projects!
